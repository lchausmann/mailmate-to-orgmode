This bundle enables Mailmate to invoke emacsclient and org-capture. 

This is the initial version, and basically everything is hard coded. 

These are the prequisites:
- Emacs installed under /Applications
- Working emacs-client setup from installed emacs
- Working org-protocol
- Working org-capture setup
- Working org-mac-message and org-mac-link setups

There must be a capture config setup like this: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org-protocol)
  (require 'org-capture)

  (setq org-capture-templates
        '(
          ("y" "Tasks" entry
           (file+headline "~/work/org/work.org" "Inbox")
           "* TODO Email: %:description                         :Mail:
  Email with subject: [[message://%l][%:description]]

  %?
  ")
          )
        )

#+END_SRC

The directory =Org.mmBundle= can be symlinked into the correct
location of MailMate. if MailMate is installed it will be something
like this: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  orgBundlePath=`pwd`
  cd /Applications/MailMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Bundles/
  ln -s ${orgBundlePath}/Org.mmBundle .
#+END_SRC

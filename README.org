This bundle enables Mailmate to invoke emacsclient and org-capture. 

This is the initial version, and basically everything is hard coded. 

These are the prequisites:
- Emacs installed from homebrew
- Working org-capture setup
- Working org-mac-message and org-mac-link setups

There must be a capture config setup like this: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (setq org-capture-templates
          '(
            ("m" "Tasks" entry
           (file+headline "~/work/org/work.org" "Inbox")
           "* TODO %^{Task}
  Mailmate link: 
  [[message://%l][Open Email]]
  
  %?
  ")
              )
          )
    
#+END_SRC

The directory =Org.mmBundle= can be symlinked into the correct
location of MailMate. if MailMate is installed it will be something
like this: 
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
ln -s Org.mmBundle /Applications/MailMate.app/Contents/SharedSupport/Bundles/.
#+END_SRC
